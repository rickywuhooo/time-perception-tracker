# Project for CS 665: Introduction to Database Systems

The time perception tracker is a simple tool that shows users their accuracy in estimating how long a task takes to complete based off of data that is input by the users. The objective of this project is to focus mainly on CRUD operations, as this is a project for a database systems course.

The project uses HTML + CSS + JavaScript for the frontend, Flask (Python) for the backend, and SQLite for the database.
